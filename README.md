hello-cbase
===========

a hello world program using chromiums base library


hello-cbase uses the same build tools as Chromium, so you'll need to set up the build environment as described in the [Chromium instructions](http://www.chromium.org/developers).

Once this is done, you can fetch the sources by doing:

>`mkdir hello-cbase`  
>`cd hello-cbase`  
>`gclient config https://github.com/wesedens/hello-cbase.git --name=src`  
>`gclient sync`
